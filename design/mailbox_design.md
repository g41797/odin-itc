# Mailbox Design

## Overview

Two mailbox types. They solve different problems.

- `Mailbox($T)` — for worker threads. Blocks using a condition variable.
- `Loop_Mailbox($T)` — for nbio event loops. Non-blocking. Wakes the loop with `nbio.wake_up`.

---

## Internal storage

Both types use `core:container/intrusive/list` internally.

The list is intrusive. The node is embedded in the user struct. No heap allocation per message.

User struct contract:
- Must have a field named `node`.
- Type of `node` must be `list.Node` from `core:container/intrusive/list`.
- Field name is fixed. Not configurable.

```odin
import list "core:container/intrusive/list"

My_Msg :: struct {
    node: list.Node,  // required
    data: int,
}
```

The `where` clause on all procs enforces this at compile time:

```odin
where intrinsics.type_has_field(T, "node"),
      intrinsics.type_field_type(T, "node") == list.Node
```

If the struct does not have the right `node` field, the compiler gives an error.

## `Mailbox($T)` — worker thread mailbox

### Roles
- Sender: any thread.
- Receiver: worker thread or client thread.

### Behavior
- Many threads can send.
- One or many threads can receive.
- If empty, the receiver thread sleeps. The OS wakes it when a message arrives.
- Uses zero CPU while blocking.

### API
- `send(msg)` — adds message, signals one waiter.
- `try_receive()` — checks for message, returns immediately.
- `wait_receive(timeout)` — blocks until message arrives, timeout, or interrupt.
- `interrupt()` — wakes all waiters with `.Interrupted`.
- `close()` — blocks new sends, wakes all waiters with `.Closed`.
- `reset()` — clears closed and interrupted flags.

### Internal send pattern
```odin
list.push_back(&m.list, &msg.node)
m.len += 1
sync.cond_signal(&m.cond)
```

### Internal receive pattern
```odin
raw := list.pop_front(&m.list)
msg = container_of(raw, T, "node")
m.len -= 1
```

## `Loop_Mailbox($T)` — nbio loop mailbox

### Roles
- Sender: worker threads or client threads.
- Receiver: the nbio event loop thread only.

### Behavior
- Many threads can send.
- One receiver only — the nbio thread.
- The nbio thread never blocks inside the mailbox.
- It blocks only inside `nbio.tick()`.
- When a sender adds the first message, it calls `nbio.wake_up` to interrupt the tick.

### API
- `send_to_loop(msg)` — adds message, calls `nbio.wake_up` if mailbox was empty.
- `try_receive_loop()` — returns one message. Never blocks. Call in a loop to drain.
- `close_loop()` — blocks new sends, calls `nbio.wake_up` once.
- `stats()` — approximate pending count. Not locked.

### Internal send pattern
```odin
was_empty := m.len == 0
list.push_back(&m.list, &msg.node)
m.len += 1
if was_empty { nbio.wake_up(m.loop) }
```

## Key differences

| Feature | `Mailbox` | `Loop_Mailbox` |
|---|---|---|
| Thread type | Worker / client | nbio event loop |
| Wait method | `sync.cond_wait` | `nbio.tick` |
| Wake method | `sync.cond_signal` | `nbio.wake_up` |
| CPU when idle | zero | zero |
| Blocking receive | yes | no |

---

## Why two types?

- A blocking receive on the nbio thread would stop the event loop.
- `Loop_Mailbox` has no blocking receive. This prevents mistakes.
- Worker threads do not need `nbio.wake_up`. `Mailbox` is simpler for them.

---

## When to use which

- Use `Mailbox` for communication between worker threads.
- Use `Loop_Mailbox` to send commands to the nbio event loop.
